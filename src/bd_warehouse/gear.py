Gears - parametric, involute gears of all types

name: gear.py
by:   Gumyr
date: July 14nd 2024

This module can be used to create a wide variety of involute spur gears,
either standard ISO (metric) or fully custom.  Involute gears have
the property of continually meshing at a specific angle (the pressure angle)
thus avoiding the stutter of non-involute gears as the teeth lose
contact with each other. Imagine a telescope mount: involute gears would
allow the telescope to smoothly follow a star as it moves across the night
sky, while non-involute gears would introduce a shake that would blur the
image of a long exposure.

Gears are art pieces unless they mesh with each other. To ensure two
gears can mesh, follow these guidelines:
    - Meshing gears need the same tooth shape and size, so use a common
      module (for metric gears) or diametral pitch value (for imperial gears).
      For fully custom gears, the base, pitch and outer radii will all
      need to be calculated appropriately.
    - When positioning two gears to mesh, they need to be separated by the
      sum of their pitch radii. For ISO metric gears this is very easy to
      do - simply multiply the gear module by the sum of the tooth count and
      divide by two (in mm), or: separation = module*(n0 + n1)/2 [mm]
